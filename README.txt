My awesome moviePro project

MoviePro is a web application where users can search movies and be returned with information on the movie. Features that are planned to be added include: watchlist, find the platform, and a scratch-off movie bucketlist poster.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, RESTful API

The project right now is only front-end. The landing page is all html, css, and javascript. The search page is also the same, but it includes an API that places information of the searched movie into placeholders on the page. I plan to make this a full-stack app, that handles log in's and profiles. With that layer added to it I can add more features to the app like a watchlist. This is an ambitious thought, but I would also like to create a virtual poster. This poster would have a bucket-list of movies that, when you watch the movie, you can scratch-off to reveal the poster of the movie beneath it. 

Lessons Learned:

From this project I learned two main things. The importance of planning a project and its features in its totality. This project also helped build my foundation of RESTful API's and GET requests. I also learned how difficult it can be to get access to an API. Unfortunately, there were some API's I was very interested in, but was not able to gain access to.
