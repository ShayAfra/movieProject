My awesome moviePro project

MoviePro is a web application where users can search movies and be returned with information on the movie. Features that are planned to be added include: watchlist, find the platform, and a scratch-off movie bucketlist poster.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, RESTful API

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

Lessons Learned:

From this project I learned two main things. The importance of planning a project and its features in its totality. This project also helped build my foundation of RESTful API's and GET requests.
